<h1>About Us</h1>
        <section class="about-text">
        <p>We will need to carry plants into space when humans travel there for both practical and horticultural reasons. Fresh flowers and gardens on the International Space Station provide a lovely ambience and allow us to bring a small portion of Earth with us on our adventures, as we already know from our pioneering astronauts. Both here on Earth and in space, they are beneficial to our psychological health. Additionally, they will be essential for maintaining astronauts' health throughout lengthy trips.

            Scurvy in sailors was only caused by a deficiency in vitamin C, and vitamin shortages can result in a variety of other health issues. Astronauts will need more than just multivitamins to stay healthy when they travel to the universe's furthest reaches. They will require fresh food.The first growth test of crops in the Advanced Plant Habitat aboard the International Space Station yielded great results. Arabidopsis seeds - small flowering plants related to cabbage and mustard - grew for about six weeks, and dwarf wheat for five weeks.</p>
